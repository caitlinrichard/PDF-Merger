# PDF-Merger

Are you tired of using unsecured, ad-ridden online PDF merging sites? Then this is for you! This PDF Merger is a simple tool that quickly combines multiple PDF files, and you can do it all on your local computer without having to upload your files to some random website. 

Simply download the main.py file, save it in a folder with the PDFs you wish to combine, and let it run its magic! 

A few notes: 
- If you need to rerun the program within the same folder to recombine the files, be sure to delete the previous output file first, or go into the program and change the name of the new_file variable. 
- The files will merge in alphanumeric order, so I suggest numbering your files in the order you want them to be combined.
